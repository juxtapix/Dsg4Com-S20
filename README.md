## Overview

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will provide students with practical skills and theoretical frameworks for making and assessing communication through design. Design principles, tools, and techniques will be covered in class, coupled with hands-on experience making and critiquing visual work. An emphasis will be placed on leveraging communication applications for interactive and narrative-driven new media art.


#### COURSE OBJECTIVES
In this 5 week class, students will utilize Adobe Creative Cloud tools, and combine storytelling, semiotics, design, and technology, to explore ways to communicate their creative ideas through animation, mind-maps, styleframes, and schematics.

#### GRADING AND ATTENDANCE
Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

30% Participation
50% Assignments
20% Reading responses and other written work

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course. Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.

#### PARTICIPATION:
This class will be highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions, give feedback to your peers, and otherwise fully participate in class.

#### TEACHING STYLE
Classes will be a mixture of synchronous lectures, workshops, discussions, hands-on demos, and asynchronous tutorials/materials.

#### COURSE SCHEDULE
The course will meet two (2) times per week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for two hours (2:00) for a total of 5 weeks. Please come to your assigned section.

#### ASSIGNMENTS
There will be regular assignments that are relevant to the class material. These assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording and video all qualify based on the assignment) on the class blog. Each assignment is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are simply not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Responses to the reading assignment can either be addressed in a traditional written format or creatively (ie.: photo essay, video, animation, data-viz, interactive media piece, etc.).
Grading will follow the same guidelines as above; on time and meeting the criteria specified will be marked as complete. Late (up to 1 week) or partially completed work will be given half credit. Work that is more than a week late, not turned in, or fails to meet the criteria specified will be given no credit.

#### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.
